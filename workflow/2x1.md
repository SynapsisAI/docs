# 2x1 Agile Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines our 2x1 agile workflow - 2-day standups and 1 weekly sync.

## Task Management

### Creating Tasks
- **Anyone creates tasks anytime** - see something? Create it
- When finishing a task, add whatever you think flows from it
- Most tasks added during planning stage of Weekly sync
- Add to Backlog by default
- Keep titles clear and specific
- Assign during sync

### Ownership
- **You run your own work** - full ownership means:
  - Move through columns (Backlog → This Week → In Progress → Done)
  - Update with comments if needed
  - When moving to Done, think "what's next?" and create follow-up tasks
  - Create your own PRs ready for review
- No micromanagement - we trust each other

## Standups

### Schedule
- **Frequency:** Every 2 days
- **Duration:** 10 minutes max
- **Format:** Quick Google Meet

### The 3 Questions
Each person answers:
1. **What did I complete?** (since last standup)
2. **What am I working on next?** (next 2 days)
3. **Any blockers?** (need help with anything?)

### Goals
- Keep momentum going forward
- Clear blockers quickly
- Stay in sync with each other
- If you have nothing to add, that's completely fine. This is not a performance meeting - it's about coordination and support.

### Can't Make It?
Just drop your 3 answers in Discord/Messenger when you have time.

## Syncs

### Schedule
- **Frequency:** Once a week (Thursday 3-4pm)
- **Duration:** 60-90 minutes
- **Format:** Google Meet

### Part 1: Review & Merge (30-45 min)
**This is where we review and merge code together**
- Go through each PR ready for review
- Share screen, walk through changes
- Everyone reviews together in real-time
- Squash merge on the spot once approved
- No async review delays - get it done now

### Part 2: Planning (30-45 min)
- Clear completed items from Done column
- Pull tasks from Backlog → This Week
- Each person commits to their tasks
- Identify dependencies or blockers
- Reality check: can we actually do all this?

### Why This Matters
- Shared understanding of what everyone built
- Immediate feedback and learning
- No PRs sitting around for days
- Everyone knows the codebase

## The Weekly Flow

**During the week:**
- Create tasks as needed → Backlog
- Work on your tasks → move through columns  
- Push code to branches/PRs
- Standup every 2 days to stay aligned

**At sync:**
- Review & merge everything together
- Clear the board
- Plan next week
- Actually talk through the code
